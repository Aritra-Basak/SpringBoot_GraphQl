# Spring Boot GraphQL Integration
## Welcome to the Spring Boot GraphQL Integration project! This repository contains a robust API developed using Spring Boot and integrated with GraphQL, enhancing the request-response mechanism for increased efficiency and flexibility.

## Features
### Spring Boot: Utilizes the powerful features of the Spring Boot framework for building scalable and maintainable applications.
### GraphQL Integration: Implements GraphQL, a query language for APIs, to streamline data fetching and provide a more efficient alternative to traditional REST APIs.
### H2 Database: Incorporates the H2 Database, an embedded, open-source, and in-memory database, suitable for rapid prototyping and proof of concepts.

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following Maven dependency:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-graphql</artifactId>
</dependency>

## H2 In-Memory Database
The project utilizes H2 Database as an in-memory database. H2 is an embedded, open-source database management system written in Java. While in-memory databases like H2 are ideal for rapid prototyping and proof of concepts due to their lightweight nature, it's important to note that they are not recommended for production environments where persistent data storage is required.
