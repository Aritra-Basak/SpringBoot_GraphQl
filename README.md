This Repository contains the code of Spring boot integrated with H2 Database, which is an embedded, open-source, and in-memory database.(Int the in-memory database, the data is stored in the system memory. It lost the data when the program is closed. It is helpful for POCs (Proof of Concepts), not for a production application.) and with all these Graph Ql is integrated. GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
